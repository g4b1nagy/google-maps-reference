# google-maps-reference

Google Maps Javascript API v3 reference


### What's this? ###

google-maps-reference is a collection of Google Maps Javascript API code examples:

* 45Â° imagery
* toggle controls
* pan control options
* street view control options
* zoom control options
* map type control options
* scale control options
* scroll and cursor
* infowindow enabled marker
* custom markers
* add markers on click
* attempt geolocation


### Why? ###

Because it's at least the 3rd time I've had to go through the documentation at https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/ for the exact same code.
