Google Maps Javascript API v3 reference

Includes code examples for the following tasks:

* 45Â° imagery
* toggle controls
* pan control options
* street view control options
* zoom control options
* map type control options
* scale control options
* scroll and cursor
* infowindow enabled marker
* custom markers
* add markers on click
* attempt geolocation

Why? Because it's at least the 3rd time I've had to go through the documentation at https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/ for the exact same code.
